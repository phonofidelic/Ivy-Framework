  Master skill for building Ivy Framework applications. Use when the user asks to
  build something with Ivy, create an app, add a feature, fix a bug, or work on
  their Ivy project. Routes to specialized skills for CRUD, dashboards, connections,

# Ivy

Master skill for building applications with the Ivy Framework.

## Pre-flight: Read Learnings

If the file `.ivy/learnings/ivy.md` exists in the project directory, read it first and apply any lessons learned from previous runs of this skill.

## Reference Files

- [references/AGENTS.md](references/AGENTS.md) -- Ivy framework API reference (widgets, hooks, layouts, inputs, colors)

Read the AGENTS.md reference for any direct implementation work. For specialized tasks, delegate to the appropriate skill below.

## Ivy CLI

Use the `ivy` CLI for documentation lookups and framework questions:

| Scenario | Command |
|---|---|
| You know the topic and want the full reference page | `ivy docs <path>` |
| You need to browse what documentation exists | `ivy docs list` |
| You have a "how do I..." question and need a synthesized answer | `ivy ask "your question"` |
| You need to understand an existing connection's schema | `ivy cli explain connections/<ConnectionName>` |

## Skill Router

When the user's request matches a specialized task, delegate to the appropriate skill instead of implementing from scratch.

### Build Apps

| User wants... | Skill |
|---|---|
| CRUD views, master-detail, data management for database tables | `/ivy-create-crud` |
| Dashboard with metrics, charts, KPIs, analytics | `/ivy-create-dashboard` |
| Custom app (chat, wizard, tool, streaming UI, bespoke layout) | `/ivy-create-app` |

### Add Connections

| User wants... | Skill |
|---|---|
| Connect to an existing database (SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) | `/ivy-create-db-connection` |
| Generate a new database with AI-designed schema and seeding | `/ivy-generate-db-connection` |
| Add authentication (Auth0, Supabase, Clerk, Basic, GitHub, etc.) | `/ivy-create-auth-connection` |
| Connect to a REST/OpenAPI endpoint | `/ivy-create-openapi-connection` |
| Connect to a GraphQL API | `/ivy-create-graphql-connection` |
| Connect to a SOAP/WSDL service | `/ivy-create-soap-connection` |
| Use a pre-built connection from the Ivy catalog | `/ivy-create-using-reference-connection` |
| Connect to any other API or service | `/ivy-create-any-connection` |

### Convert from Other Platforms

| User wants... | Skill |
|---|---|
| Convert from Airtable | `/ivy-convert-airtable` |
| Convert from Excel (.xlsx) | `/ivy-convert-excel` |
| Convert from Lovable (React/Supabase) | `/ivy-convert-lovable` |
| Convert from Odoo (Python/XML) | `/ivy-convert-odoo` |
| Convert from Reflex (Python) | `/ivy-convert-reflex` |
| Convert from Retool (.zip export) | `/ivy-convert-retool` |
| Convert from Streamlit (Python) | `/ivy-convert-streamlit` |

### Customize and Deploy

| User wants... | Skill |
|---|---|
| Create or modify a theme (colors, typography, styling) | `/ivy-create-theme` |
| Create a custom React-backed widget (wrap npm package) | `/ivy-create-external-widget` |
| Deploy as a desktop application (.exe) | `/ivy-deploy-to-desktop` |

### Releases and Maintenance

| User wants... | Skill |
|---|---|
| Generate release/patch notes by analyzing code changes since the last release | `/ivy-create-release-notes` |

## Direct Implementation

If the user's request does not match any specialized skill above -- for example, modifying existing views, fixing bugs, adding features to existing apps, or general Ivy development -- implement it directly using the AGENTS.md reference and the `ivy` CLI for documentation.

## Post-run: Evaluate and Improve

After completing the task:

1. **Evaluate**: Did the build succeed? Were there compilation errors, unexpected behavior, or manual corrections needed during this run?
2. **Update learnings**: If anything required correction or was surprising, append a concise entry to `.ivy/learnings/ivy.md` (create the file and `.ivy/learnings/` directory if they don't exist). Each entry should note: the date, what went wrong, why, and what to do differently next time.
3. **Skip if clean**: If everything succeeded without issues, do not update the learnings file.
